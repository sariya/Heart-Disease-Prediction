# Heart-Disease-Prediction
The primary objective of this project is to identify the factors contributing to cardiovascular diseases and develop a predictive model to forecast potential heart attacks. This will help in early detection and prevention, ultimately reducing the mortality rate associated with cardiovascular diseases.
